- Fixed issue where latest Zig, version, 0.12.0-dev.3156+0b2e23b06, wasn't generating floating point instructions
- Added Playdate SDK 2.4.1 API changes
- Added generation of `zig-out/pdx_source_dir` which contains the files that are passed into `pdc`. This is useful for troubleshooting issues, e.g. disassembling `pdex.elf` with `objdump` to see what assembly was generated.
